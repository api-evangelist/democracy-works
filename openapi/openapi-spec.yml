    # Introduction


    The Democracy Works Elections API provides your application with
    comprehensive elections data and voting guidance, surfacing our unparalleled
    coverage of upcoming local, state, and federal elections. Power your
    platforms, apps, reminders, outreach campaigns, and much more.


    Join the community of developers in our [Google
    Group](https://groups.google.com/a/democracy.works/g/democracy-works-data)

    for updates about our data and elections.


    ## Authentication

    Access to the Democracy Works Elections API requires authentication. To
    access the DW API, include an X-API-Key header with each API request. The
    value of that header should be your API key. For example:


    ```sh

    curl "https://api.democracy.works/v2/elections" \
        --header "X-API-KEY: <YOUR API KEY>"
    ```


    For pricing information and to obtain a test key, please [contact
    us](https://data.democracy.works/api-signup).


    ## Base URL

    The base URL for all API endpoints is: https://api.democracy.works/v2


    ## Support

    If you have any further questions or issues, please contact us at
    partnerships@democracy.works.


    ## Data


    Data is captured in two entities, an __Election__ and an __Authority__. The
    __Election__ has election-specific dates and deadlines, URLs for voters to
    get more information and take action, and detailed guidance in both English
    and Spanish. The __Authority__ includes statewide evergreen information and
    instructions on how to register and vote for each state, as well as election
    office contact information. 


    # Open Civic Data IDs (OCD-IDs)


    We use Open Civic Data IDs
    [(OCD-IDs)](https://opencivicdata.info/en/latest/ocdids.html) 

    throughout the API to describe entities and filter results. 


    OCD-IDs start with what is being identified, and in our case it is always 

    `ocd-division`.


    Since all authorities are, or are contained within, a state and all
    elections 

    are run by some authority, almost every OCD-ID in our system starts with 

    `ocd-division/country:us/state:__`, where `__` is a two-letter state postal
    code.


    The only exception to this is for the District of Columbia, which has the
    OCD-ID 

    `ocd-division/country:us/district:dc`.


    ## OCD-ID on the Authority

    The OCD-ID associated with an authority describes the political district
    covered

    by an authority. Authorities are uniquely identifiable by the associated
    OCD-ID.


    For example:

    - The OCD-ID `ocd-division/country:us/state:ak/place:anderson` is
    associated 
      with the authority for Anderson, Alaska.
    - The OCD-ID
    `ocd-division/country:us/state:ny/county:albany/council_district:2` 
      is not associated with an authority because Albany's 2nd Ward is a legislative 
      ward which does not run its own elections.

    ## OCD-ID on the Election

    The OCD-ID associated with an election describes the highest-level district 

    in which all voters have something to vote for on the ballot on Election
    Day. 

    Elections always have an associated OCD-ID, but are not uniquely

    identifiable by the associated OCD-ID.


    For example:

    - If there is a mayoral race in Philadelphia as well as a state-wide 

    measure contest in Pennsylvania on a given day, there will be one election 

    entity with OCD-ID `ocd-division/country:us/state:pa`.

    - If there is only a mayoral race in Pittsburgh in Allegheny County on a
    given 

    day, there will be an election entity with OCD-ID 

    `ocd-division/country:us/state:pa/county:allegheny`.


    # Standard Parameters

    Functionality shared between API endpoints is noted here. Each endpoint will

    specify whether it supports the following functionality.


    ## Pagination

    Any endpoint that returns multiple results supports pagination. An endpoint
    that 

    supports pagination accepts two related query parameters:

    - `pageSize`
      - Specifies the number of results requested. Defaults to 10 if not specified. The maximum value is 100.
      - Example: `pageSize=15`
    - `page`
      - Specifies the page to return, based on `pageSize`. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
      - Example: `page=2`

    You can send none, one, or both of these parameters. Each endpoint that
    supports

    pagination will have a `pagination` field in the response, which details
    what

    page of information is returned, what page size was used for the request,
    and the

    total number of results found. 


    ## Localization

    Some endpoints support localization. An endpoint that supports localization
    accepts a

    header parameter:

    - `Accept-Language`
      - Specifies the language tag for localization. Accepted values are `en`, `en-US`, `es`, and `es-US`.
      - Example: `Accept-Language: es`

    Not all fields on the response of a localized endpoint are localized. Each
    field that supports localization

    will have a `Localized` tag on its field description.


    If no localization in the requested language is found,

    localized fields will return `null`.


    ## Content Formatting

    Some endpoints support content formatting. An endpoint that supports
    formatting accepts a

    query parameter:

    - `contentFormatType`
      - Specifies the format of certain fields in the response.
        Accepted values are `html` and `json`. Defaults to `html` if not specified.
      - Example: `contentFormatType=json`

    Not all fields on the response of a formatted endpoint are formatted. 

    Formatting is generally supported on prose-like fields, including Question
    and Answer content and most instruction fields.

    Each field that supports formatting will have a `Formatted` tag on its field
    description.


    The `json`-formatted content is the content represented as an
    [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).


    ## Fields

    Some endpoints support field masking to specify a list of fields to include
    in the API response. This helps to avoid unnecessary computation and improve
    performance. An endpoint that supports field masking accepts a

    query parameter:

    - `fields`
      - Specifies the symbolic field paths to include in the response, provided as comma-separated list. See more about [Field Masks](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#field-mask).
      - Example: `fields="ocdId,date,contact.email"`

    Paths are validated against all possible fields, and providing an invalid
    path will result in a 400 response.

      summary: State authorities
      description: >
        This endpoint includes statewide evergreen information and instructions

        includes contact information for state election authorities,
        registration methods, voting methods, state-specific URLs to
        authoritative government websites, and more. 


        Authorities do not contain election-specific information such as dates,
        and while we closely monitor this data for changes and update when
        needed, Authorities information generally does not change from election
        to election.


        Authorities are returned sorted alphabetically by OCD-ID.

        The statewide authorities include evergreen information and guidance on
        how to register and vote in that state, as well as contact information
        for state election authorities. Local authorities provide contact
        information for the local election office.

        This endpoint has election-specific dates and deadlines, URLs for voters
        to get more information and take action, and detailed guidance in both
        English and Spanish. The information included reflects the voter
        registration and voting methods available in the state for that
        election, such as online, in-person, and by-mail registration as well as
        by-mail, in-person, and early voting. The election also contains some
        information from the related state authority. The default is to return
        all elections, though you can limit the response to upcoming elections
        through the use of the start date parameter. Elections are returned
        sorted chronologically by election date. 


        After an election is confirmed to be occurring, Democracy Works surfaces
        information about an election as details become available. An elections
        guidance phase describes the state of the currently available guidance.


        A `past` election is an election whose election date is in the past. A
        `known` election is an upcoming election for which key details and
        deadlines have yet to be released. An `active` election is an upcoming
        election for which details have been vetted and confirmed by the
        Democracy Works team.


        Elections are returned sorted chronologically by election date. 


        Supports the following standard parameters: see

        ### Ballot Measure Information


        Information about measures on the ballot are available for the following
        elections:

        - All federal elections

        - All statewide elections


        Ballot measure information is not included in the default response for
        an election. For ballot measure information to be included with the
        response, include the `includeBallotData` parameter with a value of
        `true`.


        Ballot data is sourced from [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/).

        The first election has all fields populated for demonstration purposes.


        The second election is a more realistic example which shows that not all

                    Active military, permanent overseas voters, and confidential

                    electors are not required to provide a Photo ID when they
                    vote by absentee ballot.

                    An indefinitely confined voter does not need to provide a
                    copy of Photo ID.

                    Instead, the witness signature on the Absentee Ballot
                    Certificate Envelope

                    satisfies the Photo ID requirement. For all other absentee
                    voters, you will

                    need to provide a copy of your acceptable photo ID with your
                    request. If you

                    have not previously provided a copy of photo ID, photo ID
                    must accompany your

                    first application by mail. <br><br>These photo IDs are
                    acceptable and can be

                    unexpired or expired after the date of the most recent
                    general election: A Wisconsin

                    revoked or suspended;

                  question: Can I register to vote on Election Day?

                    election office</a> for information on when and where to
                    register to vote. Conditional voter registration is a safety
                    net for Californians who miss the deadline to register to
                    vote or update their voter registration information. Voters
                    can use the conditional voter registration process from the
                    day after the deadline all the way through Election Day.
                    Eligible citizens can go to their county election office,
                    polling place, or vote center to register and vote
                    conditionally. These ballots will be processed once the
                    county elections office has completed the voter registration
                    verification process.</li><li>You can also register to vote
